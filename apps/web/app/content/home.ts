      'Beepa was the nickname of Walter Hopper, a Beloit native and the grandfather of our founder, Justin Fjalstad. Beepa was the kind of guy who worked with his hands, grew what he ate, and believed food tasted better when it was shared.\n\nHis garden was always full. His door was always open. And his way of doing things stuck.',

      "Justin learned early that good food doesn't need shortcuts. Years later, he started canning vegetables at home — the same way Beepa would've done it. No gimmicks. Just real ingredients and time put in.\n\nFriends tried it. Then friends of friends. Pretty soon, one jar turned into another, and Beepa's grew from there.",
